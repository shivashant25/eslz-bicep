# Exercise 1: Implement Azure landing zone accelerator
## Context

The Azure landing zone accelerator architecture is modular by design and allows organizations to start with foundational landing zones that support their application portfolios, regardless of whether the applications are being migrated or are newly developed and deployed to Azure. The architecture enables organizations to start as small as needed and scale alongside their business requirements regardless of scale point.
The AdventureWorks company wants to start with Landing Zones for their workload in Azure, where hybrid connectivity to their on-premise data center is not required from the start. 

### Reference Architecture

The Azure landing zone accelerator architecture is modular by design and allow organizations to start with foundational landing zones that support their application portfolios and add hybrid connectivity with ExpressRoute or VPN when required. Alternatively, organizations can start with an Azure landing zone accelerator architecture based on the traditional hub and spoke network topology if customers require hybrid connectivity to on-premises locations from the beginning.

A hub and spoke network topology allows you to create a central Hub VNet that contains shared networking components (such as Azure Firewall, ExpressRoute and VPN Gateways) that can then be used by spoke VNets, connected to the Hub VNet via VNET Peering, to centralize connectivity in your environment. Gateway transit in VNet peering allows spokes to have connectivity to/from on-premises via ExpressRoute or VPN, and also, [transitive connectivity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/create-a-transit-vnet-using-vnet-peering/) across spokes can be implemented by deploying User Defined Routes (UDR) on the spokes and using Azure Firewall or an NVA in the hub as the transit resource. Hub and spoke network design considerations & recommendations can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/traditional-azure-networking-topology).

## Customer Profile

This reference implementation is ideal for customers that have started their Azure landing zone accelerator journey with an Azure landing zone accelerator foundation implementation and then there is a need to add connectivity on-premises datacenters and branch offices by using a traditional hub and spoke network architecture. This reference implementation is also well suited for customers who want to start with Landing Zones for their net new
deployment/development in Azure by implementing a network architecture based on the traditional hub and spoke network topology.

## Task 1: Deploy the Azure Landing zone accelerator

In this task, you are deploying the Azure landing zone accelerator with hub and spoke architecture. To start with deploying, we will use the AdventureWorks reference implementation ARM template. 
1. Copy the below URL and paste it in a new tab on the edge browser inside your JumpHost where you have already logged in to Azure portal. If the credentials window popup again then enter the Azure credentials provided below.
    * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

      ```
      https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2FeslzArm%2FeslzArm.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2FEnterprise-Scale%2Fmain%2FeslzArm%2Feslz-portal.json
      ```

1. On the **Custom deployment** blade, under the `Deployment location` section, choose the **Region** as `Central US` and click on **Next: Azure core setup.** This region will primarily be used to place the deployment resources in an Azure region, but also used as the initial region for some of the resources that are deployed, such as Azure Log Analytics and Azure automation.

1. On the **Azure corp setup** section, provide a Management Group prefix (for this lab, we will use **eslz** as the prefix).
   - **Resource prefix (Root ID)(1):** `eslz` 
   - **Select dedicated subscriptions or single subscription for platform resources (2):** `Dedicated (recommended)`
   - Leave the **Customer Usage Selection Options** as default.   
   - Click on **Next: Platform management, security, and governance >(3)** to move to the next section.

   ![](images/CAF-ex1-t2-p3.png)
   
1. On the **Platform management, security, and governance** blade, you will configure the core components to enable platform monitoring and security. The options you enable will also be enforced using Azure Policy to ensure resources, landing zones, and more are continuously compliant as your deployments scale and grows. To enable this, you must provide a dedicated (empty) subscription that will be used to host the requisite infrastructure. Use the following configuration:
   - Select **Yes (recommended) (1)** option for **Deploy Log Analytics workspace and enable monitoring for your platform and resources**.
   - **Management subscription (2):** `Prefix Management Sub - suffix`, here Suffix is some numeric value
   - **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Email Contact (3):** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - Leave the other options as default and click on **Next : Platform DevOps and automation > (4)** to move on next section.

    - Leave default value for all other options
    - Click on **Next: Landing zone configuration > (2)** to move to Landing zone configuration tab.

    ![](images/identitynew.png)
    
    > Note : If you don't find the **Prefix - Identity Sub - Suffix** subscription in the environment then select **Prefix - Governance Sub - Suffix** subscription.
    
1. Under the **Landing zone configuration** section,
   - Select **Yes (recommended) (1)** for *Connect corp landing zones to the connectivity hub (optional)?*,
   - From **Subscriptions** select **Prefix Landing Zones Sub - Suffix** and **10.50.0.0/24 (2)** for Virtual Network Address space. Provided subscription will be bootstrapped as landing zones and governed by Azure Policy. This subscription will be bootstrapped as landing zones with a virtual network deployed and connected to the hub virtual network for corp connectivity. Virtual networks on these subscriptions will be connected to the hub virtual network using VNet peering, and if you deployed and enabled Azure Firewall as DNS proxy, DNS settings on these VNets will be configured with the Azure Firewall private IP address.
   - Now, click on **Next: Review + create > (3)** to review the input parameters you have given and selected.

    ![](images/LZCnew.png)
 
1. On the **Review + Create** page, the required permission and configuration will be validated before you can deploy. Once it has been validated successfully, you can click on **Create** to begin the deployment process.

   ![](images/create-lz-01.1.png)

     > **Note**: Once deployment begins don't close the deployment page, so that you can review the deployment status.
    
1. Once the template deployment is completed you will see **Your deployment is complete** message on deployment page. It will take up to 90 Minutes to finish. You can however proceed to the next Exercise i.e. Exercise 2 on the next page of lab guide and you can come back and check if deployment is succeeded, if it is succeeded then you can resume back to the remaining steps in Exercise 1 and then Exercise 3.

   > **Note**: There is know issue with deployment, deployment fails with policy assignments. This is a a known issue you potentially can run into as described here: https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/EnterpriseScale-Known-Issues.md#deploying-the-reference-implementation-fails-due-to-policy--cannot-be-found-404
   > **Fix deployment**: Redeploy the template by following above steps which fix the issues most of the time. 

    ![](images/deployment-succeed-01.png)
    
**Note**: If you see the following error as per below screen with deployment, then please follow the [resolution from here](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Know-Before-You-Go/blob/main/AIW-KBYG/AVW-Cloud-Adoption-Framework(CAF).md#3--sometimes-template-deployment-fails-with-below-error)

### Task 2: Validation post deployment

1. Once Azure landing zone accelerator has deployed and you enabled the CI/CD bootstrap, you should validate in your GitHub account that:
   * A new repository **eslz** has been created, with the name provided during setup.

1. To check the repository, login to your personal [Github](https://github.com/) account with your GitHub credentials. 
1. In the above right corner, right click on your GitHub profile and then select **Your repositories**.

   ![img](images/github-profile-repo.png)

1. Now, under **repositories**, enter **eslz** in the search box to look for the repository. If the repository has been created successfully, it will be listed in search result. Select the repository **eslz** to explore it.

   ![img](images/repository-eslz.png)
   
1. Now, click in the **Settings** to explore the repository settings.

   ![img](images/select-repo-settings.png)
   
1. Under settings, select **Secrets**.

   ![img](images/select-repo-secrets.png)
   
1. Verify the 4 secrets with following names below has been already created under **Action secrets**. 

   * ARM_CLIENT_ID = Service Principal
   * ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = Service Principal Client Secret created in the Tenant
   * ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = The management subscription ID created in the Tenant
   * ARM_TENANT_ID = Tenant ID of the Azure Tenant that was used to create ESLZ

   ![img](images/varify-secrets.png)
   
1. Now, under **Actions**, verify a Workflow **Enterprise-Scale Deployment** is either in progress or has completed and automatically merged into the main branch. If you see it failed please ignore and proceed to next step, it merged the PR automatically but inside the pull process it may show failed merge. This error message won't impact any fuctionality of lab, so you can proceed further.

   ![img](images/check-workflow.png)
      
1. The Azure hierarchy that got created using ARM templates as part of the Azure landing zone accelerator setup, such as management groups, subscription organization as well as policy definitions, policy assignments and role assignments are hydrated and organized into Git Under the **Code** section.

   ![img](images/ra-eslz.png)
   
1. Click on the **root/eslz (eslz)** folder. Under that in each folder, you will find the ARM templates that were deployed at the scopes during the Azure landing zone accelerator setup. E.g., on the intermediate root group, you will find all policy definitions, and depending on the selection you made during the deployment, you will find resource templates in the platform subscriptions. Users can – whenever they are ready, start using these templates and bring their own templates to manage the platform using ARM templates and infrastructure as code.

## Post deployment activities

Once Azure landing zone accelerator has deployed, you can grant your application teams/business units access to their respective landing zones. Whenever there’s a need for a new landing zone, you can place them into their respective management groups (Online or Corp) given the characteristics of assumed workloads and their requirements.
